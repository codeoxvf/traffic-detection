# Live traffic jam detection
- Live traffic images from:
https://data.gov.sg/dataset/traffic-images

- Classifies traffic in an image into 'empty', 'light' or 'heavy'
    - is this the best set of classes?
- with limited variety, model may be learning locations instead of traffic flow
(at the same time the same locations will have similar traffic)
